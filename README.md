# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset, one of the most widely used datasets in machine learning and computer vision. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9).

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. These images are labeled with the correct digit, making it a perfect dataset for supervised learning tasks.
